# Embargo Ransomware Attack Process

## Overview
The Embargo ransomware group is a new cyber threat actor that employs **Rust-based** malware and sophisticated **evasion techniques** to compromise target systems. The group uses **double extortion** tactics by encrypting data and threatening to leak it unless a ransom is paid.

## Attack Process Breakdown

### 1. Initial Access & Deployment
- Attackers gain initial access via **phishing emails, exploits, or stolen credentials**.
- Once inside, they deploy **MDeployer**, a malicious loader that executes the ransomware and an EDR-disabling tool.

### 2. Evasion & Security Disabling
- **MS4Killer** is used to disable security software by exploiting a vulnerable driver.
- Attackers use **Safe Mode** to neutralize security defenses before executing the ransomware.
- Each ransomware payload is **custom-built per victim**, making detection difficult.

### 3. Encryption & Data Theft
- The ransomware is written in **Rust**, allowing cross-platform attacks on **Windows and Linux**.
- Before encryption, sensitive data is **exfiltrated** to use for **double extortion**.
- Files are encrypted, leaving victims unable to access their data.

### 4. Ransom Demand & Extortion
- Victims receive a **ransom note** demanding payment for a decryption key.
- If the ransom is not paid, stolen data is published on Embargo's **leak site**.

### 5. Continuous Development & Adaptation
- The ransomware is **actively developed**, with different versions observed.
- Bugs, artifacts, and evolving techniques suggest ongoing refinement of attack tools.
- Embargo operates as a **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)**, offering its tools to affiliates.

## Conclusion
Embargo is a **highly sophisticated ransomware group** that uses **advanced security evasion techniques**, **Safe Mode execution**, and **Rust-based payloads** to maximize impact. Their **custom-tailored attacks** and **RaaS model** make them a growing threat in the cybersecurity landscape.

**Defensive Measures:** Organizations should prioritize **endpoint security**, **regular software updates**, and **employee awareness training** to mitigate risks associated with Embargo ransomware.
